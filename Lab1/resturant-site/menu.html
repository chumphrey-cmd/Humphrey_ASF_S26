<h1>Our Menu Vision</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to our steam-powered cafe and bakery, where we believe that a beautiful plate is better than an ugly one. Whether you are an airship captain or a mechanical engineer, our meals are designed to elegantly fuel your day. In a bustling world of gears and cogs, our culinary philosophy is straightforward: simple, handcrafted flavors are better than complex, over-engineered dishes.
</p>

<h2>We Value The Quality of Our Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to what goes into our food, explicit is better than implicit. We proudly and openly source our heritage grains from local wind-powered mills and our produce from hydroponic greenhouse terraces. Cultivating top-tier, sustainable agriculture can be a complex process, but we firmly believe that a thoughtful, complex ecosystem is better than a complicated, artificial supply chain.
